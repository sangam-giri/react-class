# Learning and Documentation
This doc contains all the important stuffs that I encountered while trying to learn React Js

# Key things 
These are the key things that I need to learn and understand while learning React

## React Fundamentals
- How functional components work (as I am from OOP background)
- JSX and how they are translated to Js
- Props
- Rendering list (map)
- Conditional Rendering

## State Management
- useState
- Immutable updates
- Derived state
- Controlled components

## Effects and lifecycle (Critical)
- useEffects
- Dependency Array
- Cleanup functions
- When effects run 
- Avoiding infinite loops


## Forms and Events
- onChanged, onSubmit
- Controlled Vs uncontrolled inputs
- Prevent default behaviour 
- Basic Validation 

## Component Composition
- Children prop
- Reusable components
- Container Vs presentational components
- Passing callbacks to children

## Lifting State Up & Data Flow
- Parent -> child props
- Child -> parent callbacks
- Sharing state between siblings


## Context APIs (Needed for Next.Js)
- createContext
- useContext
- When to use context vs props
- Avoiding overuse

## Basic routing concepts 
- What a SPA is 
- Client Side navigation
- Page level components
- Route params (conceptually)

## Data Fetching Patterns
- Fetching in `useEffets`
- Loading States
- Error Handling 
- Race conditions
- Abort Controller (optional but nice)

## Performance Basics (Light but useful)
- Re-renders
- `React.memo`
- `useCallback`
- `useMemo`

## Error Handling & Boundaries 
- Try/Catch in async calls
- Error boundaries



# React Readiness Checklist of Next Js
A must know/do prior Next JS
- Build a CRUD app
- Handle forms and validation
- Fetch and display data
- Share state across components
- Debug re-render issues
